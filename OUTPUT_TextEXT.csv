We investigated the possibility that MKs observed in honey are also the products of bacteria present in honey. The bacterial composition of honey was analyzed using culture-dependent methods. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and MALDI-TOF showed prevalence of the members of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus groups. The dominant menaquinones in both bacteria and honey were menaquinones MK-7 and MK-8 as indicated by UHPLC–ESI-MS/MS coupled to quadrupole orbitrap. The EICs showed alignment of mass ions of MK-7 and MK-8 from culture supernatants with that of honey. The unique MS/MS fragmentation pattern indicated that fragment ions were arising from the same menaquinone present in both samples. During Bacillus growth, the accumulation of MK-7 in supernatants occurred in a stationary phase and coincided with cell death. These novel findings suggest that the soluble MKs in honey originate from shedding of cell membranes of dead vegetative cells.","Long-chain menaquinones (MK) are of bacterial origin.

However, it is difficult to obtain high titers of infectious virus, principally due to the toxicity of the expressed gene which affects on virus replication in the host HEK293 cells. To avoid these problems, we generated a Cre-loxP-regulated fluorescent universal vector (termed pAxCALRL). This vector produces recombinant adenoviruses that express the red fluorescent protein (RFP) instead of the inserted gene during proliferation, which limits toxicity and can be used to monitor viral replication. Expression of the gene of interest is induced by co-infection with an adenovirus that expresses Cre-recombinase (AxCANCre). Recombinant adenovirus produced by this system that express Hnf4α and Foxa2 were used to reprogram mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) into induced-hepatocyte-like cells (iHep) following several rounds of infection, demonstrating the efficacy of this new system.","The recombinant adenoviral gene expression system is a powerful tool for gene delivery.

In this work, bioleaching of aluminium (Al) metal from spent catalyst was investigated by using three Aspergillus strains (A. niger, A. foetidus, and A. carbonarius). Bioleaching was performed in batch culture mode at different loading densities of spent catalyst (i.e., 0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2% (w/v)). The highest Al leaching efficiency of 88.43% was obtained at 0.8% ((w/v)) catalyst loading using A. foetidus, further increase in the catalyst loading decreased the efficiency. In addition to this, molasses was used as a carbon source (low-cost) at various concentrations for bioleaching of spent catalyst and the results were found to be significant at 40 g/L sugar concertation with 60% bioleaching efficiency.

Biosensors used in wound care benefit from a chromogenic signalling due to the readiness of signal interpretation, but the most common use faint yellow chromogenic molecules such as p-nitroaniline (pNa).

The cleavage sequence for HNE (Ala-Ala-Pro-Val) was embedded into the sensing moiety of the substrate corresponding to the 11th β-sheet. In the presence of HNE, the 11th β-sheet is able to interact to the signalling moiety composed of the β1-β10 incomplete barrel, allowing the re-establishment of the chromophore environment and, hence, the colour production. Structural homology and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to aid on the disclosure of the structural changes that are the base of the mechanism of action of this HNE switch substrate.

To contribute to the increasing demand for bio-based and sustainable materials, it is of great importance to develop optimal enzyme formulations which can replace the yet poorly controlled traditional dew retting process. Regarding the chemical composition of the fiber, enzymatic treatments all resulted in similar improvements, with an enhanced cellulose content of 81 ± 1% after polygalacturonase + xylanase treatment (vs. 64 ± 2% for green fibers). Evaluation of extraction efficiency (EE) showed that several enzyme combinations significantly increased EE in comparison with green fibers. An EE of 23 ± 6% was found for fibers extracted after polygalacturonase + pectinmethylesterase treatment, in comparison with an EE of 11 ± 1% for green fibers.

To utilize their potential as continuous resource of biological and biochemical products, an efficient separation method is required. Solvent based extraction methods have a negative impact on mycorrhizal spore viability and vitality. Accordingly, we developed a biocompatible extraction method where spore and root viability is maintained with efficient extraction of rosmarinic acid. We screened temperature- and sonication-assisted techniques in ethanol, methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, ionic liquid and surfactants. An inverse relationship was found between an increase in temperature and mycorrhizal and root viability. Optimum temperature for extraction was 30 °C. Most suitable solvents were 10% methanol; 0.25 M ionic liquid and dimethyl sulfoxide. Ethanol, nonane, dodecane, Triton X-100 and Tween-20 were not found suitable.

(SR-4) and phosphorus solubilizers Aspergillus niger (A. niger) and to evaluate their efficiency as biofertilizers for agricultural practices.MethodsTwo biofertilizer including nitrogen fixing and phosphorus solubilizing were grown. The nitrogen fixing efficiency of Azotobacter (SR-4) was determined by Kjeldahl method. Similarly, Vanadomoybdate method was used to measure the soluble phosphorus while Heinonen method was used to analyze concentration of phytase and phosphatase in the cultures. Furthermore, both biofertilizers were tested in a field trail on Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd) and Abelmoschus esculentus (okra).ResultsThe Azotobacter (SR-4) strain was found efficient nitrogen fixer as 35.08 mg of nitrogen per gram of carbon was produced after 72 h of fermentation. Similarly, A. niger strain excrete extracellular phosphate solubilizing enzymes such as phytase (133UI in 48 h of fermentation) and phosphatase (170UI in 48 h of fermentation) which can solubilize the rock phosphate and make it available to plants.

(SR-4) and phosphorus solubilizers Aspergillus niger (A. niger) and to evaluate their efficiency as biofertilizers for agricultural practices.MethodsTwo biofertilizer including nitrogen fixing and phosphorus solubilizing were grown. The nitrogen fixing efficiency of Azotobacter (SR-4) was determined by Kjeldahl method. Similarly, Vanadomoybdate method was used to measure the soluble phosphorus while Heinonen method was used to analyze concentration of phytase and phosphatase in the cultures. Furthermore, both biofertilizers were tested in a field trail on Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd) and Abelmoschus esculentus (okra).ResultsThe Azotobacter (SR-4) strain was found efficient nitrogen fixer as 35.08 mg of nitrogen per gram of carbon was produced after 72 h of fermentation.

No conclusive differences in microwave and conventional heating were found with heating rate controlled.
